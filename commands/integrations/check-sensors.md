tags: [project, gitignored]
---

Analyze sensor entities:

1. Sensor Inventory
   - List all sensor entities
   - Group by integration/platform
   - Count by device class
   - Show total sensor count

2. Sensor Health
   - Identify unavailable sensors
   - Find sensors with stale data (not updating)
   - Check for sensors with error states
   - Note sensors with unexpected values

3. Data Quality
   - Review sensor update frequency
   - Identify sensors with missing data
   - Check for sensor value anomalies
   - Assess sensor reliability

4. Battery Sensors
   - List all battery-powered sensors
   - Show current battery levels
   - Identify low battery devices
   - Predict battery replacement needs

5. Environmental Sensors
   - Temperature sensors and readings
   - Humidity sensors
   - Light level sensors
   - Motion sensors activity

6. Utilit & Monitoring
   - Energy/power monitoring sensors
   - Network monitoring sensors
   - System resource sensors
   - Custom monitoring sensors

7. Configuration Issues
   - Find misconfigured sensors
   - Identify unused sensors
   - Suggest sensor consolidation
   - Recommend sensor additions

Provide sensor health report with actionable recommendations.

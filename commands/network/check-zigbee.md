Verify Zigbee network configuration and operation (skip if Zigbee not configured):

1. Zigbee Coordinator Status
   - Check coordinator connectivity
   - Verify coordinator firmware version
   - Review coordinator model and capabilities
   - Check USB device status

2. Network Information
   - Display PAN ID and network channel
   - Show device count (routers, end devices)
   - Review network permit join status
   - Check network extended PAN ID

3. Device Health
   - List all Zigbee devices
   - Check device link quality (LQI)
   - Identify offline or unavailable devices
   - Show battery levels (battery devices)
   - Review last seen timestamps

4. Network Topology
   - Display network map/topology
   - Identify router devices
   - Show device routing paths
   - Find devices with weak connections
   - Assess coordinator proximity

5. Performance Analysis
   - Check message delivery success rate
   - Identify network interference
   - Review channel congestion
   - Assess overall network stability

6. Device Configuration
   - Verify device reporting intervals
   - Check device bindings
   - Review cluster configurations
   - Identify misconfigured devices

7. Maintenance Recommendations
   - Suggest devices for re-pairing
   - Recommend firmware updates
   - Identify devices causing issues
   - Suggest channel changes if interference detected
   - Recommend additional routers if needed

8. Integration Status
   - Check Zigbee2MQTT/ZHA status
   - Review integration logs
   - Verify MQTT connection (if Zigbee2MQTT)
   - Check for integration errors

Provide Zigbee network health report with optimization suggestions.

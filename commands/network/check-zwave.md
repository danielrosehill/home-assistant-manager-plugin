Verify Z-Wave network configuration and operation (skip if Z-Wave not configured):

1. Z-Wave Controller Status
   - Check Z-Wave controller connectivity
   - Verify controller version and firmware
   - Review controller uptime
   - Check USB device status

2. Network Information
   - Display Home ID and network key status
   - Show node count
   - Identify controller capabilities
   - Review network mode (S0, S2, etc.)

3. Node Health
   - List all Z-Wave nodes
   - Check node status (ready, asleep, dead, failed)
   - Identify nodes with poor communication
   - Show node battery levels (battery devices)
   - Review last communication time

4. Network Performance
   - Check network latency
   - Identify routing issues
   - Review failed message counts
   - Assess network congestion

5. Node Configuration
   - Verify node associations
   - Check node groups
   - Review parameter settings
   - Identify misconfigured nodes

6. Maintenance Needs
   - Identify failed nodes for removal
   - Suggest nodes needing firmware updates
   - Recommend network healing if needed
   - Note devices with persistent issues

7. Security Status
   - Check S2 security status
   - Verify encrypted communication
   - Review security key configuration
   - Identify unsecure nodes

Provide Z-Wave network health assessment with actionable recommendations.
